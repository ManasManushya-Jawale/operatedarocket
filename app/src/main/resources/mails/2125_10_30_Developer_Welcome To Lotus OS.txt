Hi Player,
    Thanks for installing Lotus OS.
    I hope you are comfortable in this Operating System.
    This Lotus Operating System is an OS that cares for your privacy and security, just like mother Nature.
    This OS has a lot of customizable features implemented in it by default.
    No one really uses it yet, but we are grateful to know that you are the first person
    to experience how it feels to live in an Operating System that treats you as the Mother Nature's son.
