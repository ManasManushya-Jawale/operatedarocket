# Operate Da Rocket
This is a shell based java spring shell game made by Manas Manushya.
This game is under development and may be completed upto a few months.
I am an indie developer and I made this game like such that it can be ran just from the powershell.
For those who don't know what the heck powershell is, it is the newer version of windows command prompt.
In short, its where you can type prompts.
