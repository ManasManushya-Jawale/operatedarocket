**INTRODUCTION - Universe 0**
Universe 0 is a game collection that i am currently making.
This game collection is named Universe 0 because it shows how small
our universe is compared to other worlds.
It is a name that makes our infinite someone's nothing

**ABOUT THE GAME - Insider**
Right now, there is only first game, Operate Da Rocket under development,
the reason that I reposted the same posts because that one was different.
This Operate Da Rocket game will be GUI based while my  previous one was a terminal based,
It will feel a bit to much ironic about using terminal based operating systems in 22th century,
and I said 22th Century because that's where the plot of the game is set.

**Plot**
The Universe 0 's infinite race starts in 2027 when a group of well-educated scientist create a space organization called GSEP (Gramhston's Space Exploration Program) after the name of the agenci's founder, Gramhston. They get really good development and a lot of things happen but I am to lazy to tell all that

**Operate Da Rocket**
Operate Da Rocket is the first game of the game collection - Universe 0 that takes place in the 22th century when SEA has grown up into ISEP (International Space Exploration Program) and has became the most powerful. You are a space astronout who gets notified about the ISTM (Interstellar Space Travel Program) by his friend Nolan Gilmore who is a scientist in the ISEP, you rejister for it and you get selected for it. But then you get to see warning letters, bl@ckmails, voi!ence, and more but you have to continue to get in it. Now, you are in the space ship, in intestaller space. You can't return earth due to UnderWorlds and can't stay still due to Asteroids, so you must keep exploring it.

The game actually starts from your operating system, the Lotus OS which is not though a real OS, is a virtual that I have made.
