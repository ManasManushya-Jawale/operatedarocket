# Operate Da Rocket
This is a shell based java spring shell game made by Manas Manushya.
This game is under development and may be completed upto a few months.
I am an indie developer and I made this game like such that it can be ran just from the powershell.
For those who don't know what the heck powershell is, it is the newer version of windows command prompt.
In short, its where you can type prompts.

**Note**
Operate Da Rocket is the first issue of my series **Universe 0** where the humanity tries to reach space but humans
themself try to pull humanity back into slavery, rivalry, etc.
You are not the Protagnist nor Antagonist, you are the part of this big picture,
standing for 72 years in a 10000 years of human struggle but leaving a path
everytime you take step into this world with your foot.
You are alive now may not be a big thing,
but you should care about your life here
because your desendants are behind you, requesting you to survive
at all cost.
